# Awesome Rust Data Science & Bioinformatics [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)



A curated list of **Rust crates, libraries, tools, and resources** for data science and bioinformatics.  
See the [awesome-rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust) for a more comprehensive and less focussed list of crates of interest.

Adapting [awesome-semantic-web](https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-semantic-web) contribution mechanisms:

- to add something to the list please either go to https://github.com/commons-research/awesome-rust-datascience/blob/main/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request. Alternatively, add a comment with a link to [awesomelets](https://github.com/commons-research/awesome-rust-datascience/issues/1). Pull requests will be evaluated shortly for inclusion while awesomelets will be evaluated at some indeterminate time in the future.

- Looking for something but can't find it? Add it to the ["Does it exist"](https://github.com/commons-research/awesome-rust-datascience/issues/2) list and we'll keep an eye out for it. If it's a good idea maybe someone will come along and create it!
